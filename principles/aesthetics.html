      <!-- <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">We use the term “aesthetics” in its fairly ordinary and common sense as reflected in dictionary definitions such as <b>“an artistically beautiful or pleasing appearance”</b> (The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language), or as <b>“a pleasing appearance or effect: Beauty”</b> (Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary). The term “visual” indicates concentration on the visual sense, which is the central human sense, occupying “almost half the brain” (Ware, 2008, ix). Thus, this chapter is not about various other phenomena studied under the “aesthetics” heading, such as literary aesthetics, abstract forms of aesthetic experiences or criteria (e.g., the elegance of mathematical proofs), or reactions to object qualities that do not immediately and primarily stem from its visual attributes.</p> -->

      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Aesthetics as a concept was founded in 1750. Up until then, the notion did not exist or rather, it was equal to artistic beauty – a beauty based on proportions, harmony and symmetry for the most. Still, the terms “aesthetic” and “beautiful” are considered interchangeable by most people. However, when the concept was founded by Alexander Baumgarten in his book ”Aesthetica” in 1750, he attributed the word with another meaning; it was that which could be experienced and thus known via the senses. In this he tried to propose a new science, but the notion of aesthetics was quickly connected to art and judgment of taste by contemporary philosophers like Kant and Hume. </p>

      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">The whole process has been eloquently summarised by Udsen and Jørgensen:</p>
      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 grey-area"><b><i>“Although aesthetics is far from a new invention, it has never achieved a commonly accepted foundation as a theoretical discipline. Subsequently, the task of self-definition is one of the most stable features of the discourse in aesthetics.“</i></b></p>

			<h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><span class="principles-tag">Principle:</span> Fashion should never trump usability</h4>
			<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Generating artificial obsolescence through fashion is a time-honoured and effective way to sell everything from clothing to cars. A new fashion should not and need not detract from user-performance: Enormous visual and even behavioural changes can be carried out that either do not hurt productivity or markedly increase it.</p>

			<h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><span class="principles-tag">Principle:</span> User test the visual design as thoroughly as the behavioural design</h4>
			<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">User test after aesthetic changes have been made, benchmarking, where applicable, the new design against the old. Ensure that learnability, satisfaction, and productivity have been improved or at least have stayed the same. If not, newly-added aesthetics that are causing a problem need to be rethought.</p>

      <h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><span class="principles-tag">Principle:</span> Aesthetic design should be left to those schooled and skilled in its application: Graphic/visual designers</h4>
      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Leave it to the experts - they will take care of it</p>
