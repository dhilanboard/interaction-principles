      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Human-interface objects are separate and distinct from the objects found in object-oriented systems. Our objects include folders, documents, buttons, menus, and the trashcan. They appear within the user’s environment and may or may not map directly to an object-oriented program’s object. In fact, many early GUI’s were built entirely in non-object-oriented environments.</p>
			
			<h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><span class="principles-tag">Principle:</span> Human-interface objects can be seen, heard, felt, or otherwise perceived</h4>

      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Human interface objects that can be seen are quite familiar in graphic user interfaces. Objects that are perceived by another sense such as hearing or touch are less familiar or are not necessarily recognized by us as being objects. Ring tones are auditory objects, for example, but we tend to just think of them as ring tones, without assigning any higher-level category to them.</p>

      <h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><span class="principles-tag">Principle:</span> Human-interface objects have a standard way of being manipulated</h4>

      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Buttons are pressed, sliders are dragged, etc.</p>

      <h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><span class="principles-tag">Principle:</span> Human-interface objects have standard resulting behaviours</h4>

      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Dropping a document on a trash can does not delete it, it stores it in the trash can. Selecting “Empty Trash” is necessary to actually delete it.</p>

      <h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><span class="principles-tag">Principle:</span> Human-interface objects should be understandable, self-consistent, and stable</h4>

      <h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><span class="principles-tag">Principle:</span> Use a new object when you want a user to interact with it in a different way or when it will result in different behaviour</h4>

      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">If dropping a document on your delete-document icon will destroy it instantly and permanently, do not make it look like a trash can. People come with expectations about previously encountered objects. It’s important not to confuse or water down such expectations. For example, if you use a trash can icon, but instantly destroy documents dropped into it, it broadens the rule for trash cans. Instead of the rule remaining: “Dropping a document on a trash can does not delete it. Rather, it stores it in the trash can. Selecting ‘Empty Trash’ is necessary to actually delete it,” it will shift to, “Dropping a document on a trash can will destroy it either right now or sometime in the next six months to a year.” That is not only confusing for your users, it is damaging to every other developer that uses the trash can icon in the proper way.</p>
